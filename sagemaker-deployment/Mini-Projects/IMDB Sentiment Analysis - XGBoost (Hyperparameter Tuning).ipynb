The first is to use the low level functionality of SageMaker which requires knowing each of the objects involved in the SageMaker environment. The second is to use the high level functionality in which certain choices have been made on the user's behalf. The low level approach benefits from allowing the user a great deal of flexibility while the high level approach makes development much quicker. For our purposes we will opt to use the high level approach although using the low-level approach is certainly an option.\n",

What this method does is upload the data to the default bucket (which is created if it does not exist) into the path described by the key_prefix variable. To see this for yourself, once you have uploaded the data files, go to the S3 console and look to see where the files have been uploaded.\n",
