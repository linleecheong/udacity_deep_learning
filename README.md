# udacity_deep_learning

This is my personal repository of codes and homeworks from the Udacity deep learning course. 
It consists of Jupyter notebooks used during instruction, along with the provided solutions.

Some of my solutions were completed in the Dockers provided by the course, and I will be
moving over gradually.

Python 3.5 required
GPU also needed for some of the notebooks
